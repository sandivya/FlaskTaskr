A <b>'Task Management'</b> application based on Flask.

This is a 'Learn By Doing' kind off DIY project right now. 

Current goal here is to learn & develop an API based Flask Application and gain knowledge about End-To-End web application development lifecycle using Python. This app will go from scratch to production ready, with multiple security features like session control and password hashing.

Future goal includes deploying this application on AWS, and making it available to people, practicing propery concurrency during execution.
